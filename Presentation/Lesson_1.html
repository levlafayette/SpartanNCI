* Partner Shares (Government agencies, medical research centres, and universities). Each NCI partner distrubutes its share their discretion. ANU has its on merit scheme.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 1: Registration Process
* Start at `https://my.nci.org.au/mancini` and follow the prompts. You need to use your institutional e-mail address. You will be asked for a project code.
* The Lead Chief Investigator (CI) of the project will be e-mailed for approval. Once approved, a username will be generated and e-mailed to you. 
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 1: Registration Process
* If you wish to join another project (subject to approval) goto my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/projectID/join
* All usage of compute systems is accounted against projects.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 2: Login Process
* The hostname for Gadi is gadi.nci.org.au. As with similar systems logins are via SSH.
* The command `ssh username@Gadi.nci.org.au` will put the user one of the login nodes; use -Y for X-Windows forwarding.
* Consider using an SSH config and/or passwordless SSH).
* Ten login nodes.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 2: Shell Environment
* Gadi login configuation is located at `.config/gadi-login.conf`
* This can be used to change the the default project and the CLI shell that Gadi initiates, which is bash by default (e.g., `SHELL /bin/tcsh`). If you try to use a shell not registered it will default to bash.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 2: Login Nodes
* Interactive process on the login nodes have a time (30mins) and memory (2GB) limit. 
* More time or memory intensive interactive processes should be submitted as an interactive job (see PBS section).
* Default project can be temporarily switched for interactive sessions with `switchproj project_name` (not job submission)
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 2: Accounting
* There are a couple of accounting scripts which allow users to monitor their usage on Gadi. These include:
* `nci_account` to display project usage in the current quarter and recent history. Also shows the `/short` and massdata storage system for the projects the user is connected to. Has a -v, verbose, option.
* `lquota` displays your disk usage and quota in your home directory and the /short/project/ directories
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 2: Filesystem /home
* Quota of 10GB (up from 2GB on Raijin) on `/home`. Intended for configuration files and source-code.
* Working data should be stored on `/scratch`, `/g/data`, and JOBFS files systems.
* Old Raijin home directorys located in `$HOME/raijin_home`.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 2: Filesystem /scratch
* The temporary file system for Gadi users is `/scratch`, which is subject to an automated file purging policy; files are removed 90 days after the time of last modification (mtime).
* No, don't try using `touch`. It will result in account deactivation.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 2: Filesystem /scratch
* More permanent files should be stored in project directories on the `/g/data` file system.
* Safety quotas, to prevent accidental overpopulation of the file system, will be applied to projects on `/scratch` (in development). 
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 2: Filesystem /g/data
* Projects have a default `/g/data/$projectID` directory. Default quota is yet to be finalised.
* Good place for persistent files.
* The `/g/data/$projectID/gadi-usage` directory contains .csv files of usage.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 3: Environment Modules
* Gadi uses the tcl-based environment modules system (v4.3.0)
* The usual commands are avail; `module avail`, `module list`, `module load`, `module unload`, `module purge`, `module switch`, `module display` etc. No `module spider`! 
* Environment modules are not preserved between login and compute nodes.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 3: Modules Software
* Note that software on Gadi is not as varied (quantity) or as extensive (toolchain) that on Spartan.
* When software is loaded the toolchain that it was built with is automatically loaded as well (e.g., `module load python3/3.7.4`)
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 3: Extensions
* A small set of Python extensions exist for each install (e.g., `module load python3/3.7.4`, `python3`, `help("modules")`.
* A small set of R extensions exist for each install (e.g., `module load R/4.0.0`, `R`, `installed.packages(lib.loc = NULL, priority = NULL, noCache = FALSE, fields = NULL, subarch = .Platform$r_arch)`
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 3: Scheduler and Queues
* Gadi uses PBS Professional v19 as the scheduler and resource manager.
* Many queues; `express`, `normal`, `copyq`, `hugemem`, `gpu`, `gpupascal`, `knl`, `normalbw`, `expressbw`, `normalsb`, `megamem`.
* Full list with `qstat -q`
* Different queues have different costs to the project and default walltime.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 3: Job Listing
* Listing of current jobs available through `qstat`; alternatives are `qstat -a`, `nqstat`, and `nqstat_anu`. The latter two list the number of jobs in each queue, `nqstat` updates every 30 seconds, and `nqstat_anu` updates instantaneously.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 3: The Main Queues
* The standard queue is `normal`, 2 SU per resource-hour, based on the higher of CPUs, or memory divided by 4GB.
* The high priority queue for debugging, testing etc is `express`, limits in CPU and walltime. Charge rate is 6 SU per resource hour. SUs based on CPUs or memory divided by 4GB.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 3: Data Movement
* The data movement and management queue is `copyq`. These nodes have a dedicated external network interface. No computation on these node. Charge rate is 2 SU per resource hour, based on CPUs or memory divided by 4GB.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 3: MDSS and copyq
* Use mdss commands in copyq jobs to copy data to/from the massdata system; always use `-lother=mdss` when using mdss commands. 
* Ensures that a job will only run if the mdss system is operational.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 3: HugeMem Queue
* The `hugemen` queue has 1.5TB of persistent memory, 1.6TB of local disk, but only 1400GB can be requested by jobs.
* Charge rate is 3.0 SU per resource hour, based on CPUs or memory divided by 32GB.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 3: GPUvolta Queue
* The nodes have 4 Telsva V100s each; 384 GBytes of RAM on CPU, 
480 GBytes of SSD local disk. 
* Charge rate is 3.0 SU per resource hour, based on CPUs or memory divided by 8GB.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

* `normalbw`, `#PBS -q normalbw`
* `normalsl`, `#PBS -q normalbw`
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 4: Core Job Controls
* To submit a job use `qsub $JobName`. Job status can be determined by `qstat $JobID`, `qstat -s $JobID` or `qstat -u $Username`, or `qdel $JobID` to delete a job. To review a job's details use `qstat -f $JobID`.
* Standard output and error streams are collected by PBSPro and saved in `<Jobname>.o<Jobid>` for standard output and `<Jobname>.e<Jobid>` for standard error.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 4: Additional Job Controls
* To put a user hold on a job use `qhold $JobID`, and  `qrls -h u $JobID` to release. 
* A job's queue can be changed with `qmove $Newqueue $JobID`.
* A job can be terminated and relaunched with `qrerun $JobID`
* A job selection can be shown e.g., `qselect -u $username -l ncpus.gt. $number`	
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 4: Optional PBS Directives
* `#PBS -N job_name` for job name
* `#PBS -j oe` or `eo` to combine output and error files; also `-e directory` or `-o $directory` for specific locations.
* `#PBS -m abe` for mail when job aborts, begins, ends. Combine with `-M $email` directive.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 4: Site-Requisite Directives
* Jobs must explicitly declare the file systems accessed. Files in `/scratch/$project` and `/g/data/$project` directories must include the directive  `-lstorage=scratch/$project+gdata/$project`. 
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Part 4: Hardware Considerations
* Gadi has Intel Xeon Platinum 8274 (Cascade Lake); Two physical processors per node; 3.2 GHz clock speed; 48 cores per node and 192 GB memory for the normal/express/copyq nodes.
* The PBS_JOBFS (local storage) size on Gadi normal/express/copyq nodes are limited to 400 GB per node. For larger jobs use `/scratch`. 
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
